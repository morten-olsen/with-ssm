> Run any command with secrets from AWS SSM Parameter Store - no more secrets in
> `.env` files!

## What is this?

`with-ssm` is a lightweight CLI tool that automatically replaces SSM parameter
references in your environment variables with their actual values from AWS SSM
Parameter Store before executing your commands.

Think of it as a security upgrade for your development workflow - instead of
storing sensitive values directly in `.env` files, you reference SSM parameters
that get resolved at runtime.

**Why you'll love it:**

- üö´ **No more secrets on disk** - your `.env` files only contain SSM references
- üîÑ **Always up-to-date** - secrets are fetched fresh from SSM every time
- ‚úÖ **Safe to commit** - your `.env.with-ssm` files can be safely added to
  version control
- üéØ **Drop-in replacement** - works with any command that uses environment
  variables

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @0morten-olsen/with-ssm
```

## Quick Start

1. **Replace secrets in your `.env` file with SSM references:**

```env
# .env.with-ssm
DATABASE_URL="SSM:/myapp/database/url"
API_KEY="SSM:/myapp/external/api-key"
JWT_SECRET="SSM:/myapp/auth/jwt-secret"
```

2. **Run your commands through with-ssm:**

```bash
with-ssm -- npm start
```

That's it! Your application gets the real secret values, but they never touch
your filesystem.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run any command with SSM-resolved environment variables
with-ssm -- npm start
with-ssm -- node server.js
with-ssm -- docker-compose up
```

### With Inline Environment Variables

```bash
# Mix inline SSM references with file-based ones
API_TOKEN="SSM:/external/api-token" with-ssm -- npm run deploy
```

### Custom Files

```bash
# Use specific environment files
with-ssm --file .env.production --file .env.secrets -- npm start
```

### AWS Configuration

```bash
# Use specific AWS profile and region
with-ssm --profile production --region us-west-2 -- npm start
```

## Command Line Options

| Option      | Alias | Description                 | Default                     |
| ----------- | ----- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `--file`    | `-f`  | Environment file(s) to load | `['.env', '.env.with-ssm']` |
| `--region`  |       | AWS region for SSM          | AWS SDK default             |
| `--profile` |       | AWS profile to use          | AWS SDK default             |
| `--help`    | `-h`  | Show help                   |                             |

## SSM Parameter Format

Use the `SSM:` prefix followed by your parameter path:

```env
# These all work:
DATABASE_PASSWORD="SSM:/myapp/db/password"
API_KEY="SSM:/external-services/stripe/api-key"
SECRET_TOKEN="SSM:/auth/jwt-secret"
```

Parameters are fetched with decryption enabled, so SecureString parameters work
out of the box.

## File Loading Priority

`with-ssm` loads environment variables from files in provided order with later
files override earlier ones, just like you'd expect.

## Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Application Behavior

If your application loads `.env` files directly (like with `dotenv`), it might
override the SSM-resolved values. To avoid this:

- Use `.env.with-ssm` instead of `.env` for SSM references
- Or use environment variable substitution if your app supports it:
  `${API_KEY:-SSM:/myapp/api-key}`

### üöÄ Deployment Considerations

- Don't deploy `.env` files with your application if they contain SSM
  references, and you have not added SSM resolution using `with-ssm`
- Consider using native AWS parameter resolution in production environments
- The tool requires AWS credentials configured (via AWS CLI, IAM roles, or
  environment variables)

## AWS Setup

Make sure you have AWS credentials configured. Any of these methods work:

```bash
# AWS CLI
aws configure

# Environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"

# IAM roles (in AWS environments)
# Automatically detected
```

Your AWS user/role needs `ssm:GetParameters` permission for the parameters
you're accessing.

## Examples in the Wild

### Node.js Development

```bash
# .env.with-ssm
DATABASE_URL="SSM:/myapp/dev/database-url"
REDIS_URL="SSM:/myapp/dev/redis-url"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="SSM:/myapp/stripe/secret-key"

# Run your dev server
with-ssm -- npm run dev
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Load secrets and start containers
with-ssm -- docker-compose up
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```bash
# Deploy with production secrets
with-ssm --profile production -- npm run deploy
```

## How does `with-ssm` compare to...?

`with-ssm`'s philosophy is to be a lightweight utility that enhances your
existing workflow, not a heavy framework that replaces it. Here‚Äôs how it
compares to other tools.

### vs. `.env` files & `dotenv`

`with-ssm` is a security upgrade for the `dotenv` pattern. Instead of storing
secrets in plaintext `.env` files, you store secure `SSM:` references that are
safe to commit to version control. Your app gets the secrets it needs at
runtime, but they never live on your disk, giving you the same simple developer
experience with a major security boost.

### vs. `aws-vault`

These tools are complementary and solve different problems. `aws-vault` securely
manages your local AWS _credentials_, while `with-ssm` uses those credentials to
fetch and inject application _secrets_. They work perfectly together‚Äîuse
`aws-vault` to handle authentication and `with-ssm` to handle secret resolution:
`aws-vault exec my-profile -- with-ssm -- npm start`.

### vs. `chamber`

`chamber` is a more powerful CLI for the full lifecycle of secret management
(reading, writing, listing), while `with-ssm` is a lightweight utility focused
only on resolving secret references from a file. Choose `with-ssm` for its
"drop-in" simplicity and zero-config approach to enhance an existing `.env`
workflow; choose `chamber` if you need a more comprehensive command-line tool
for advanced SSM tasks.

### vs. Cloud-Native Integrations (ECS, Lambda)

`with-ssm` is built for **local development and CI/CD**, allowing your local
environment to securely mirror production. When your code is running _inside_ an
AWS environment like ECS or Lambda, you should always use the native best
practice: grant the service an IAM role to fetch secrets directly via the AWS
SDK.

### vs. Full Secret Management Platforms (HashiCorp Vault, Doppler)

Platforms like Vault or Doppler are comprehensive, often multi-cloud solutions
with their own UIs and infrastructure. `with-ssm` is a focused, AWS-native
utility, not a platform. It's the ideal choice for teams already using AWS who
want a simple, direct way to leverage SSM Parameter Store without the
operational overhead of a separate service.
